# Features 

### Common Elements
The common elements across all four pages of the website are the Header and Footer sections. 
+ The Header - This section appears at the top of all pages and consists of a gif logo which sits on the left, and a navigation 
menu which is on the right. The logo and menu will adjust on different sized screens. It is clear to the user which page they are on due to the underline in the navigation menu. Featured on all four pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home, About, Menu and Contact pages. It is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation. This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. It includes a gif logo which makes the website modern. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/navigation-bar.png">

+ The Footer - This section appears on the very bottom of all pages. It contains four social media icons which can take the user to the necessary social platform. It also contains copyright information. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/footer.png">


### Home Page
This is will be the first page a user sees when they open the website. It is also the page that the user will be taken to if they click on the gif logo. The home pages consits of the following: 
+ Hero Image - This image covers the whole width of the page and has an animaiton effect so it's the first thing the user sees. It 
consists of the restuarants name and also some abstract designs to give it a modern look. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/banner-image.png">

+ Welcome Text - This section is underneath the hero image. It was added to make the user feel welcome to the website. It also contains some text on how to use the website effectively through the use of shortcut links. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/welcome.png">

+ Video - This section contains a high quality video of Tacos being prepared by a chef. It gives the user an idea of how the tacos look and are prepared.

+ Call-to-action Boxes - This is the fifth and final section of the home page. It consists of three boxes and links to add another method of accessing the different pages of the website. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/call-to-action.png">

### About Page
This is the second page of the websites and is used to tell the Owners story and give a brief history of their restuarant. 
I used one high quality image of the owners to show how they are a family business. This makes the user feel that they are genuine and gives them more confidence eating there. I also included a quote from Lovin Dublin to add even more confidence. 
<img src="https://github.com/AdamVictory/Oaxaca-Taco-Bar/blob/main/wireframescreenshots/about-us.png">


### Menu Page
This page is used to list all of the food items available on their menu and their prices. I wanted to keep this simple so the focus would be on the food and it is very easy to read while scrolling down. The sections in the page are small plates, tacos, vegan tacos, cocktails, red wine, white wine and beer. I didn't want to overstyle this as I think it's easier to read the way it is.

### Contact Page
This page effectively shows all the different methods the user can get in touch with the restuarant.There are three different sections to the contact page. 
+ General Information -  It also has a contact form and google maps embeded.

# Testing

## Cross-Browser Testing 
I tested the website across 3 web browsers that are Mozilla Firefox, Google chrome and Safari. The site worked on all of these web broswers. 


## Compatibility Testing 
I tested on many differnet devices such as Apple Macbook pro, Dell laptop, Apple Ipad, Samsung Galaxy. No major issues were found. 


## Responsiveness Testing 
I used Google Chromes developer tools to test thee responsiveness of the website throughout development. I designed the website for different screen sizes such as 800px (medium screen size), 600px (small screen size) annd 400px (ultra small screen size). 

### The Header 
Once the viewport is below the width of 800px the navigation menu stacks underneath the logo. I had to adjsut the margin and padding to make it look better. 

### The Footer 
The footer does not contain a lot of text therefore it worked on most screen sizes. It clased with the social icons on 600px and below. 


### The Banner 
The banner image only appears on the homepage. On smaller screen sizes it was too tall and not wide enough.  


### Homepage - Welcome text, video, call to action panels


### About Page



### Menu Page


### Contact Page


## User Testing 











In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.

The colour scheme in this project consists of three colours: Black, White and Orange. They complement eachother very well and creare good contrast. I used Coolers. 

## Icons 
[Font Awesome][https://fontawesome.com/] was used for the social media and title icons. 

## Text Content 
The Majority of the text content was made by myself. The only thing I took was the menu items from a similar Mexican restuarant called Masa.
